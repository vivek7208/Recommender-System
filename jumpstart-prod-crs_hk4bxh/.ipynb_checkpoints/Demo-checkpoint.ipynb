Matrix factorization (MF) is a well-known approach to solving such a problem. Conventional MF solutions exploit explicit feedback in a linear fashion; explicit feedback consists of direct user preferences, such as ratings for movies on a five-star scale or binary preference on a product (like or not like). However, explicit feedback isnâ€™t always present in datasets. NCF solves the absence of explicit feedback by only using implicit feedback, which is derived from user activity, such as clicks and views. In addition, NCF utilizes multi-layer perceptrons to introduce non-linearity into the solution."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e612a84f-91c5-4053-842d-8235d5639a97","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"source":["#### Architecture overview"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"536e302e-56e1-401f-8253-d55acc0bca21","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"source":["An NCF model contains two intrinsic sets of network layers: embedding and NCF layers.
